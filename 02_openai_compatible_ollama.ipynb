But wait, I should make sure there's no confusion with other cities. Let me think. France has several important cities like Lyon, Marseille, and Bordeaux, but the capital is definitely Paris. I think Paris is the seat of government and the main administrative center. Also, it's well-known for its historical significance and landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Louvre Museum. I'm pretty confident that the answer is Paris. But maybe the user is testing if I know that sometimes people might confuse other cities, so I should confirm that it's indeed Paris. Yes, I'm sure about that.\n",
